Most of the professional stuff can be inferred from or found on my LinkedIn
profile so here is some other stuff that is probably less obvious:

- I sign up for more Coursera courses than I can complete.
- I buy more books than I can read.
- I am a _recovering_ coffee addict.
- I am a sucker for time-travelling romance stories and cheesy animated flicks.
- I watch movies/tv shows at >=1.7x speed.
